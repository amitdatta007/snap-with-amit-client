                <p>SQL or the Structured Query Language is the most common and popular programming language for the relational database management system. It is a language designed to extract, store, insert, delete, update and manage data for structured data and strategic analysis.SQL is widely used by top tech companies like Facebook, Whatsapp, etc for data processing solutions. It is used for different types of RDBMS including Oracle, MySQL, SQLServer, etc. <br /> <br />
                NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modelled other than tabular form. It was introduced by Carl Stroz in the year 1998 called a Non-relational database. Now, it stands for Not only SQL. It is not limited to storing data in tables, instead, enables the big data to be stored in the structured, unstructured, semi-structured or polymorphic form.

                <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold'>What is JWT, and how does it work?</h2>
                <p>JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued. <br /> <br /> JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized using base64. In the most common serialization format, compact serialization, the JWT looks something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz.

                <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold'>What is the difference between javascript and NodeJS?</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a simple programming language that can be used with any browser that has the JavaScript Engine installed. Node.js, on the other hand, is an interpreter or execution environment for the JavaScript programming language. <br /> <br />
                For executing JavaScript on the server, Node.js is a bridge, open-source Js runtime environment. JavaScript code can now execute outside of the browser, thanks to Node.js. Node.js has many components and is primarily used for web development. It may run on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. It provides a cross-platform runtime environment for developing highly scalable server-side JavaScript applications with event-driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O.

                <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold'>How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?</h2>
                <p>NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them. EventLoop is the listener for the EventQueue. If NodeJS can process the request without I/O blocking then the event loop would itself process the request and sends the response back to the client by itself. But, it is possible to process multiple requests parallelly using the NodeJS cluster module or worker_threads module.
